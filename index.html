        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <img src="images/cloud-computingpic.png" alt="" id="image-right" >
        <ul>
            <li><b>Price-performance and cost savings</b> Although an initial financial investment is required to implement a cloud strategy, organizations save substantial amounts in the long run because they don’t have to maintain expensive hardware or local data centers. Also, since there are no upfront costs to use cloud-based systems, businesses can test them out before investing in them at their own pace. Oracle provides price-performance and flexible sizing.
            </li>
            <li><b>Quick application deployment</b> is the design of products, devices, services, vehicles, or environments so as to be usable by people with disabilities.</li>
            <li><b>Business continuity</b> In the event of disaster or unforeseen circumstances, do you have an effective backup plan? If not, relying on cloud computing services can benefit your organization. Cloud computing uses infinite data storage space and systems that can be activated remotely if necessary to ensure business continuity.</li>
            <li><b>Higher performance and availability</b> By using cloud computing resources together simultaneously, you reap greater performance gains than by having your own dedicated server hardware. Cloud computing increases input/output operations per second (IOPS).</li>   
            <li><b>Centralized data security</b> When you use cloud computing, data backups are centralized in the cloud providers' data centers, removing the need for individual users or teams to maintain their own backups onsite or offsite. This lowers the risk of data loss should any one backup fail or be destroyed by a disaster. Cloud providers can restore the data from another copy maintained in their cloud storage, which is continuously updated with every piece of data added.
           <li><b>Accessibility anywhere, with any device</b> each branch or office across various states or countries. The improved accessibility doesn’t just impact employees; clients and customers can also log in to an account and access their information as well. This ensures everyone has up-to-date information whether they’re at the office or on the go.
           <li><b>Instant business insights</b> Cloud-based platforms provide a unique opportunity to access data as soon as it’s collected. This facilitates better decision-making as well as insight into what the future may hold for your organization based on predictions from historical data.
          <li><b>Virtualized computing</b> Cloud computing is perfect for virtualized computer environments because cloud resources can be allocated instantly to support significant increases in demand so you never experience downtime again. With cloud computing, your business can expand its capabilities almost effortlessly to meet growing demands without increasing staff or capital expenditures.
           <li><b>Ability to get rid of most or all hardware and software</b> With cloud computing, you’re no longer required to have your own server, cables, network switches, backup generators, redundant routers, and so on. Depending on the cloud provider you choose, they can manage all of this for a monthly fee. Reducing expenses is essential in any business model and every cloud-based platform benefits from this factor alone.
           <li><b>Cloud computing is greener</b> Cloud computing is a greener technology than traditional IT solutions. By moving to the cloud, businesses can reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprint by up to 90%. Rather than having in-house servers and software, businesses can use cloud-based services to access the same applications and data from any computer or device with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for businesses to purchase and maintain their own IT infrastructure.
